Meta Data & Meta Tags
=====================

Anatomy of a Search Result
--------------------------
    - meta data means data that describes other data
    - is composed on individual meta tags:
        - are small snippets of text
        - helps search engine to find important information of the page
        - is found on source code
        - each page has a head element which contains meta data and is located at the top of the page
    - meta data contains:
        - title tag
        - website or url meta data
        - meta description:
            - some words will be bolded which are matching the search query
            - not all keywords need to appear together

Title tags
----------
    - it can be found by "<title>..."
    - is of the most important component of on-page optimization
    - the other most important component is the content of the page
    - should contain keywords users will likely use for search
    - it is recommended to put keywords at the top of the title tag and the brand name at the end of the title tag, separated
      by "|"

    - google emphasized keywords ar the beginning of a title tag
    - place brand name first to leverage branding
    - you can use individual keywords rather than a descriptive phrase, separarted by hyphens
    - is recommended to have the length lower than 55-60 characters, additional characters will be cut off
    - is recommended to use only 2 keywords for tight focus
    - avoid using special characters

Description tag
---------------
    - it can be founded by <meta name="description" content="">
    - keywords within meta description do not help a site rank but it helps to increase click-through to website
    - matched keywords are bolded
    - is recommented to have under 160 characters
    - if it is too long, the meta description is cut off, or google will choose another text, if it is too short, you will loose
      click-throught

    - for blogs, it is fine to let google choose the meta description, but for static pages it is better to provide a better
      description about your content

    - you can include Calls to Actions
        - will increase click through to site
        - a call to action basically ask user to perform an action
    - meta descritions are used also on social media, when somebody is posting that page link
    - is recommended to avoid using quotations

Meta Keywords
-------------
    - example: <meta name="keywords" content="">

Heading Tags
------------
    - you have primary heading ( H1 ) but also sub heading like H2, ...
    - H1 tag is most important
    - optimize heading tags with keywords
    - you should have only one h1, but as needed H2
