URL Optimization
================
    - place important keywords at the beginning of the URL
    - URL serves as its own anchor text
    - words between two slash "/" will be considered as subfolders or subdirectores and help categorize documents
    - search engines may include subdirectories if they are keywords too
    - is recommended to not have not have parameters on the url as:
        - it make the url longer
        - if the link is changed based on user (like adding sessionId as parameters), then the url will be different, but contains the same content

Changing URLs
-------------
    - when changing URL later:
        - you should take into account that the page was already ranking under existing URL
        - you will loose some of the history
        - you should redirect with status 301 (permanent redirect)
        -
