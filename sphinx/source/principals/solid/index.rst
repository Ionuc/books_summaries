SOLID
=====
    - is not a framework
    - is not a library
    - is not a pattern

    - the purpose of SOLID is to make you more productive by making code more maintainable
    - SOLID is a reaction to a set fo design smells, like :
        - rigidity : the design is difficult to change
        - fragility : the design is easy to break
        - immobility : the design is difficult to reause
        - viscosity : it is difficult to do the right thing
        - needless complexity or overdesign
