Microbenchmark Suite
====================

    - Java 12 introduces a suite of around 100 microbenchmark tests to the JDK source code.
    - These tests will allow for continuous performance testing on a JVM and will become useful for every developer wishing to work on the JVM itself or create a new microbenchmark.
