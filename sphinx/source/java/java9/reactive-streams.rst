Reactive Streams
================

    - a Publish / Subscribe Framework was introduce to implement Asynchronous, Scalable
      and Parallel application
    - new classes were introduced:
        - java.util.concurrent.Flow
        - java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher
        - java.util.concurrent.Flow.Subscriber
        - java.util.concurrent.Flow.Processor

Java 9 Reactive Streams
-----------------------

    - Reactive Streams is about asynchronous processing of stream
    - there should be a Publisher and a Subscriber. The Publisher publishes the stream of
      data and the Subscriber consumes the data

    - Sometimes we have to transform the data between Publisher and Subscriber. Processor is the entity
      sitting between the end publisher and subscriber to transform the data received from publisher so
      that subscriber can understand it. We can have a chain of processors

Java 9 Flow API
---------------

    - Java 9 Flow API implements the Reactive Streams Specification
    - Flow API is a combination of Iterator and Observer pattern:
        - Iterator works on pull model where application pulls items from the source
        - Observer works on push model and reacts when item is pushed from source to application

    - Java 9 Flow API subscriber can request for N items while subscribing to the publisher. Then the items are
      pushed from publisher to subscriber until there are no more items left to push or some error occurs.

Java 9 Flow API Classes and Interfaces
--------------------------------------

    - java.util.concurrent.Flow:
        - the main class of Flow API
        - This class encapsulates all the important interfaces of the Flow API
    - java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher:
        -  This is a functional interface
        - every publisher has to implement itâ€™s subscribe method to add the given subscriber to receive messages
    - java.util.concurrent.Flow.Subscriber:
        - Every subscriber has to implement this interface
        - The methods in the subscriber are invoked in strict sequential order
        - There are four methods in this interface
            - onSubscribe: This is the first method to get invoked when subscriber is subscribed to receive messages by
              publisher. Usually we invoke subscription.request to start receiving items from processor.
            - onNext: This method gets invoked when an item is received from publisher, this is where we implement our
              business logic to process the stream and then request for more data from publisher.
            - onError: This method is invoked when an irrecoverable error occurs, we can do cleanup tacks in this
              method, such as closing database connection.
            - onComplete: This is like finally method and gets invoked when no other items are being produced by
              publisher and publisher is closed. We can use it to send notification of successful processing of stream.
    - java.util.concurrent.Flow.Subscription:
        - This is used to create asynchronous non-blocking link between publisher and subscriber. Subscriber invokes
          its request method to demand items from publisher. It also has cancel method to cancel the subscription i.e.
          closing the link between publisher and subscriber.
    - java.util.concurrent.Flow.Processor:
        - This interface extends both Publisher and Subscriber, this is used to transform the message between
          publisher and subscriber.
    - java.util.concurrent.SubmissionPublisher:
        - A Publisher implementation that asynchronously issues submitted items to current subscribers until it is
          closed. It uses Executor framework We will use this class in reactive stream examples to add subscriber and
          then submit items to them.
