V8
==
    - is written in C++
    - compiles and executes JavaSCript source code, handles memory allocation and garbage collects leftovers
    - it design consists of 2 compilers that compile source code directly into machine code:
        - Full-codegen: a fast compiler that produces unoptimized code
        - Crankshaft : a slower compiler that produce fast, optimized code
    - if Crankshaft determines that the unoptimized code generated by Full-codegen is in need of optimization, it replaces it, a process known as crankshafting
