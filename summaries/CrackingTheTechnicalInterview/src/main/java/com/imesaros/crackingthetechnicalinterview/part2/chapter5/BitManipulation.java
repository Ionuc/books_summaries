     * Problem 1
     * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a
     * method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e.g., M becomes a substring of
     * N located at i and starting at j).
     * EXAMPLE:
     * Input: N = 1024 = 10000000000, M = 21 = 10101, i = 2, j = 6
     * Output: N = 10001010100
